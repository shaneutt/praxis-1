# FIPS Tooling

Local checks that a praxis build is on track for FIPS 140-3 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. They mirror what Red Hat's release scanner
(`openshift/check-payload`, Rust support in its PR #360) looks at, so a clean
local report predicts a clean scan. The build targets (`make release-fips`,
`make container-fips`) are in
[Getting Started](getting-started.md#fips-build-and-compliance-check), and
the operator guide is [FIPS 140-3](../operating/fips.md).

The report, the image verification and the signature-store setup are
`cargo xtask fips` commands (`xtask/src/fips/`) with Makefile wrappers. The
Makefile builds xtask without its default features (`XTASK_FIPS`), so these
targets never compile the standard proxy build; the report stage of
`Containerfile.fips` runs the same invocation.

| Command | Makefile | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cargo xtask fips report [--deps-only] [--features LIST] [--offline] [--out FILE] [BINARY]` | `fips-deps`, `fips-report`, `fips-check` | The compliance report (below). Exits 1 while findings remain. |
| `cargo xtask fips verify-image [--pinned-in CONTAINERFILE] REFERENCE` | `fips-verify-image`, run first by `container-fips` and `fips-check` | Refuses a base image that is not digest-pinned, not from `registry.access.redhat.com`, or not signed by Red Hat's release key; with `--pinned-in`, also one the Containerfile does not pin by that digest. |
| `cargo xtask fips signature-store [--install]` | `fips-signature-store` | Checks that podman's `registries.d` names Red Hat's signature store, without which every Red Hat image looks unsigned. `--install` adds the bundled entry for the current user where the podman packaging ships none (Debian, Ubuntu, GitHub's runners). CI runs it before `fips-verify-image`. |
| `check-payload scan image ...` | `fips-scanner`, `fips-scan` | Red Hat's own scanner at a pinned revision, run on the FIPS image with warnings fatal. This is the actual gate for what is in the image. |
| `cargo xtask fips host-check [--image IMAGE] [--require-certified] [--out FILE] [--json FILE]` | `fips-host-check` | On a FIPS host: attest the kernel flag, `fips=1`, the crypto policy, `fips-mode-setup --check` and the module the host's OpenSSL loads; with `--image`, the crypto policy podman propagated into the container and the build of `fips.so` the image carries, looked up in `certified-modules.json`. Exit 1 on any unmet requirement. |
| `cargo xtask fips runtime-probe IMAGE [--toolchain-image IMAGE] [--host-cargo] [--log FILE]` | `fips-runtime-probe` | On a FIPS host: start the image under `PRAXIS_REQUIRE_FIPS=1` with a TLS listener, run the listener probes of the integration suite against it (inside the toolchain image, or with the host's cargo), and check the startup status line. |

## The FIPS host run

The hosted checks prove what is in the image. What the image does in FIPS
mode can only be proven on a RHEL 9 host in FIPS mode, and the pieces below
exist so that proof is a Make target, not a manual session.

**The suites as the FIPS build.** `make test-integration-fips` runs the
schema, security, integration and resilience suites (and
`test-conformance-fips` the conformance suite) with `--no-default-features`,
so the proxy each suite starts in process is built exactly as the FIPS binary
is: the workspace declares the binary crate without its defaults, and every
test crate opts into `policy-engine` through its own default feature. The
tests that spawn the binary get the FIPS build through `PRAXIS_BIN`
(`make build-fips` produces it first) rather than the standard binary the
harness would otherwise build. `cargo tree -e normal,dev --no-default-features
-p praxis-tests-integration -i aws-lc-rs` prints nothing for that graph; only
`ring` remains, for rcgen's test certificates.

**Both branches, always.** The FIPS behavior tests
(`crates/tls/tests/fips_mode.rs`, `tests/integration/tests/suite/fips.rs`)
key their expectations on what the installed provider reports
(`praxis_tls::provider::status().provider_fips`) and assert both branches:
on a host whose OpenSSL is in approved mode they prove the refusals, anywhere
else they prove the same offers are accepted. So they run, and mean
something, on every developer machine and in the hosted CI too.
`PRAXIS_FIPS_HOST=1` declares the host to be in FIPS mode: the harness then
fails closed the first time it installs the provider on a host that is not
(both signals, provider and kernel flag), and every behavior test insists on
its approved-mode branch. A green run on the FIPS runner therefore cannot
have happened on OpenSSL's default provider.

**Inside the toolchain image.** `make test-fips-host` builds the `toolchain`
stage of `Containerfile.fips` (Red Hat's `rust-toolset` and OpenSSL, no
sources) and runs `test-fips`, `test-integration-fips` and
`test-conformance-fips` inside it against the bind-mounted checkout, with
`PRAXIS_FIPS_HOST=1` and `PRAXIS_REQUIRE_FIPS=1`. The OpenSSL and the module
under test are then the image's, the same packages the FIPS image is built
with; the kernel flag and the FIPS crypto policy are the host's, which podman
passes into the container. The container runs as the invoking user
(rootless podman's `--userns=keep-id`), since praxis refuses to start as root
and the tests that boot the real server would fail for that reason alone.
The cargo home and the target directory live in named volumes
(`praxis-fips-host-cargo`, mounted with `:U` so it belongs to that user, and
`praxis-fips-host-target`) so the second run is incremental. The run opens
with `make fips-host-facts`, which prints what the process the suites run as
actually sees (the kernel flag, the crypto policy, the providers OpenSSL
loads, whether MD5 is refused) into the log next to the results, and fails
right there when `PRAXIS_FIPS_HOST` is declared on a container that is not
in FIPS mode.

**The raw TLS probes.** `tests/utils/src/tls_probe.rs` builds `ClientHello`
records that offer exactly what a test names (ChaCha20 only, X25519 only,
TLS 1.2 without Extended Master Secret) and reads the listener's first record
back: a `ServerHello` means accepted, an alert means refused. A rogue server
does the reverse for the upstream client: it records what praxis offered and
answers with a chosen `ServerHello` or alert, then watches for the client's
alert. No cryptography is involved, which is the point: the probes work
against any listener, including the shipped image, on any host.

**The fixtures.** `tests/integration/fixtures/fips/` holds a short RSA key
and a SHA-1-signed certificate, with the commands that made them in its
`README.md`.

## Simulating approved mode

A host that is not in FIPS mode can still exercise the approved-mode branch
of every behavior test, against Red Hat's real module, by activating the
FIPS provider for the test processes alone with the bundled configuration
(`xtask/assets/fips/fips-provider.cnf`). Inside the toolchain image:

```console
make fips-toolchain
podman run --rm --userns=keep-id --security-opt label=disable -v "$PWD":/src -w /src \
    -v praxis-fips-host-cargo:/cargo:U -v praxis-fips-host-target:/target \
    -e OPENSSL_CONF=/src/xtask/assets/fips/fips-provider.cnf \
    praxis-fips-toolchain make test-fips test-integration-fips test-conformance-fips \
        FIPS_TARGET_DIR=/target FIPS_CARGO_EXTRA=--ignore-rust-version
```

The provider reports approved algorithms only, so the tests prove the
refusals; the kernel flag still reads `0`, so the `PRAXIS_REQUIRE_FIPS` test
proves the refusal to start instead of the serving path, and
`PRAXIS_FIPS_HOST` must stay unset (it would fail closed, correctly). Test
infrastructure only: the application never activates a provider itself.

## The runner job

The `fips-host` job of the `FIPS` workflow runs on the self-hosted runner
labeled `fips` and `rhel`: a RHEL 9 host in FIPS mode with `git`, `make`,
`podman`, `gnupg2`, `gcc`, `gcc-c++`, `cmake` and `openssl-devel` installed
(the host-side commands are `cargo xtask fips` and compile there, and
`verify-image` checks Red Hat's signatures through gpg; the suites compile
inside the toolchain image). The runner's group must grant this public
repository access, which GitHub does not do by default. Its steps are the composite action
`.github/actions/fips-host`, so the release workflow can run the same checks
against a pushed image.

It tests the exact image the hosted `ubi-image` job built and scanned: that
job saves the image as an artifact with its id (`make fips-image-save`), and
the runner loads it and checks the id against the one the hosted job
recorded (`make fips-image-load`). A self-hosted runner must never run a
fork's code, so on pull requests the job runs only for branches of this
repository; it runs on every push to main, nightly, and on dispatch. The release workflow's `fips-host` job
pulls the pushed `-fips` image by digest, attests and probes it (without
repeating the suites), and the draft release waits for it.

## What the report checks

1. **Dependency graph**: no crate from the scanner's `rust_denied_crypto`
   list (`ring`, `aws-lc-rs`, `sha2`, `hmac`, ...) in the shipped binary's
   normal dependency graph, resolved for the assessed feature set.
2. **Binary**: links the system `libcrypto.so.3` dynamically, defines no
   symbol of a bundled crypto backend (`ring_core_`, `aws_lc_`, `BORINGSSL_`,
   `OPENSSL_`), imports OpenSSL, and carries the rustc producer string and
   the cargo-auditable manifest (`.dep-v0`, built from cargo's SBOM
   precursor, listing no denied crate).
3. **Source guards**: the application never enables a FIPS provider itself,
   never uses OpenSSL's legacy (non-provider) digest API, and never vendors or
   statically links OpenSSL.

Each finding says why the scanner cares, where to look and what to do.

`--deps-only` skips the binary checks. `make fips-deps` runs the report that
way, after checking that the `CARGO_FEATURES` default in `Containerfile.fips`
matches `FIPS_FEATURES`, and `make lint` runs `make fips-deps`.

## Data compiled into xtask

From `xtask/assets/fips/`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `redhat-release-key-2.asc` | Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2), the GPG key Red Hat signs its container images with. See provenance below. |
| `registry.access.redhat.com.yaml` | The `registries.d` entry that tells podman where Red Hat's signature store is. podman reads one `registries.d`: `~/.config/containers/registries.d` when it exists, else `/etc/containers/registries.d`. `verify-image` checks that this directory names the store, and `signature-store --install` writes the file into the user's directory when it does not. Fedora and RHEL ship the same entry in containers-common; Debian and Ubuntu ship no `registries.d` at all. |
| `fips-provider.cnf` | An `OPENSSL_CONF` that activates the RHEL FIPS provider for one process, so the report can probe FIPS behavior on hosts that are not in FIPS mode. Test infrastructure only; the application never enables FIPS itself. |
| `certified-modules.json` | The builds of Red Hat's FIPS provider module, by the version string the module reports, with their standing at NIST: on an active certificate, in validation, or historical, each with the packages that carry it and the source that was checked. `host-check` looks the loaded build up here. Re-verify the sources whenever a UBI pin or a RHEL release changes, and add new builds as Red Hat ships them. |

### Provenance of the signing key

`redhat-release-key-2.asc` was downloaded on 2026-09-22 from
`https://access.redhat.com/security/data/fd431d51.txt`. Its fingerprint,
`567E 347A D004 4ADE 55BA 8A5F 199E 2F91 FD43 1D51`, matches the one Red Hat
publishes for "Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2)" at
`https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key`. `verify-image` recomputes the
fingerprint on every run (RFC 4880 v4: SHA-1 over the public key packet, in
Rust) and stops if it differs; `cargo test -p xtask fips` checks the same.
podman's signature check needs gnupg (it verifies `signedBy` policies through
gpgme), and `verify-image` checks for it first.

The copy of this key inside the UBI image is an older export that lacks the
binding for the subkey Red Hat now signs with, so the published file is used
instead.

## cargo-auditable

Red Hat's scanner finds pure-Rust cryptography through the crate list that
`cargo auditable build` embeds in the binary (the `.dep-v0` section), and
grades a binary without one inconclusive. The UBI builder installs
`cargo-auditable` from crates.io at the version pinned in `Containerfile.fips`
(`CARGO_AUDITABLE_VERSION`). `make release-fips` uses it when it is installed
locally (`cargo install cargo-auditable --version 0.7.6 --locked`) and warns
when it is not. The Rust Secure Code Working Group maintains it; it embeds
data only, never code. The report decodes the section itself (zlib-compressed
JSON).

### Why the build uses cargo's SBOM precursor

The manifest must list exactly the crates compiled into the binary: the
scanner fails on a denied crate's name alone, whether or not its code was
linked. On a stable toolchain cargo-auditable derives the list from
`cargo metadata`, whose resolve is not the build's:

- It unifies features across every workspace member, dev-dependencies
  included. rcgen in the tls and protocol crates pulls `ring`; the test
  utilities enable the policy engine, which pulls `aws-lc-rs`, `sha2` and
  `hmac`.
- It activates weak features (`dep?/feature`) the real build never turns on.
  rustls always enables rustls-webpki's `alloc`, whose `ring?/alloc` entry
  puts `ring` in the resolve of a binary that never compiled it. No rustls
  user can avoid that one.

Cargo's SBOM precursor (`build.sbom`, unstable behind `-Zsbom`) comes from
cargo's own unit graph and is exact; cargo-auditable 0.7 reads it when
present. So `make release-fips` and `Containerfile.fips` run:

```console
RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 CARGO_BUILD_SBOM=true cargo auditable -Zsbom \
    --config 'env.RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP.value="-1"' \
    --config 'env.RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP.force=true' \
    build --release -p praxis-proxy ...
```

`RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` lets a stable cargo accept the `-Z` flag. It also turns
cargo's guard against a build script setting `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP` through
`cargo:rustc-env` from an error into a warning; that value never reaches
rustc. The two `env` overrides give rustc and every build script
`RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=-1`, which rustc treats as "no unstable features", so the
compiled code is exactly the stable code. The build scripts of proc-macro2
and thiserror probe for unstable APIs when the variable is set; with `-1` the
probes fail, as they do without it. The report checks the manifest's `format`
field, which is 8 when it came from the precursor, so a build that silently
fell back to `cargo metadata` is a finding.

Cargo before 1.99 does not relink a binary when only the SBOM setting
changed (rust-lang/cargo#15695, fixed by #17216), so both recipes remove the
old binary first; drop that once the toolchains in use are 1.99 or newer.
Drop the whole workaround once `build.sbom` is stable
(rust-lang/cargo#13709).

## Red Hat's scanner

`make fips-scanner` fetches `openshift/check-payload` at `CHECK_PAYLOAD_REV`
in the Makefile (the head of its PR #360, fetched by commit so a rewrite of
the PR cannot break the build) and builds it as upstream does
(`CGO_ENABLED=0 go build`, vendored modules) into `target/fips/check-payload/`.
It needs Go 1.26 or newer. Point `CHECK_PAYLOAD` at another build to use that
one instead.

`make fips-scan` runs the scanner on the FIPS image in podman's image store
(under `podman unshare` when podman is rootless) with `--fail-on-warnings`,
so an inconclusive verdict such as a missing manifest fails, as in Red Hat's
gated scans. It needs a Linux podman, rootless or root, not a podman machine.
It also needs the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) on `PATH`: the scanner refuses to
start without it, although an image scan never runs it.

Move `CHECK_PAYLOAD_REV` forward once the PR merges or a release carries Rust
support.

## Updating the pinned base images

The digests live in the `Makefile` (`FIPS_UBI9_DIGEST`,
`FIPS_UBI9_MINIMAL_DIGEST`) and, as defaults, in `Containerfile.fips`. For
each of `ubi9/ubi` and `ubi9/ubi-minimal`, look up the new digest and verify
it:

```console
curl -sI -H 'Accept: application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json' \
  https://registry.access.redhat.com/v2/ubi9/ubi/manifests/latest | grep -i docker-content-digest
cargo xtask fips verify-image registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi@sha256:<new digest>
```

Update both files only once verification passes. `make fips-verify-image`
fails while they disagree.
